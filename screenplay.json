The NAREB audience would likely lean in to giving authority to the map as a general reference system to their own world, despite inaccuracies they may not be familiar with in other territories. Therefore they give power to the cartoon (mis?)representations and the map gains concept independence by replacing their previous mind map with this new representation through an internal validation. So a general audience may deem this art, whilst the intended audience considers it a map."

To that end, and based on previous points, this map could be either. We don't fully know the author intended to distort and misrepresent since he was never a classicaly trained cartographer. However, the keys are certainly there for persuasiveness that Tulsa was the new hot thing in the Real Estate Business and should be kept in the foreground for NAREB. It also could be voiced that persuasive maps are only powerful when they reach a large audience. So if the only people viewing the map were at this meeting it may not have been that powerful to the country at large. However the board was making decsions for the future of real estate and therefore future urban development. As Tyner (2015) qouted Speier (1941) "maps are not confined to the representation of a given state of affairs. They can be drawn to symbolize changes, or as blueprints of the future..." It's possible this is the future Tulsa realtors envisioned."
